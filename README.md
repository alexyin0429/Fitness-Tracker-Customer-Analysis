## Fitness Tracker Customer Analysis
### Investigating Fitness Tracker Buyers’ Characteristics and Determining Factors Influence Sleep Tracking Function Performance

This project is responsible for analyzing two questions regarding the Mingar wearable fitness
tracker. The first question is about the differences between customers who purchase Active or
Advance products and customers who purchase traditional products such as devices from the
Run product line. The second question is about whether darker skin color of customers affects
the performance of the sleep score function, or there some additional variables will affect it as
well. In terms of the first questions, we have two findings:

- We can conclude that new customers care mostly about the low price, the latest version product in the market, and whether the device has GPS while traditional customers care about having the best set of functions for outdoor
activities and have higher budgets.

• After fitting the statistical model, we conclude that when given an arbitrary neighborhood
and a fixed household income level, the odds of a customer being a new customer
increased by 45.6% approximately as age increased from 17 years old to 92 years old. Thus,
older people are likely to become the new customers under these given conditions. At a
given neighborhood and a fixed age level, the odds of a customer being a new customer
increased by 7.1% approximately as household median income increased from 41,880 dollars
to 195,570 dollars. Hence, people from higher income households are more likely to
become new customers under the given conditions.
In terms of the second question, we have three findings:
• Since we are interested in the relationship between customers’ skin color and the number
of quality flags that occurred during the sleep session, Figure 1 showed that darker-skinned
customers had the largest range of the occurrence of the number of flags per minute with
respect to a sleep session.
• From the fitted model, we observed that users’ age and skin color affected the number of
flags that occurred during the sleep session. Specifically, the average number of quality
flags for a certain customer whose skin color is dark and who is 17 years old was 0.034.
The average number of quality flags that would occur during a sleep session decreases by
0.06% when the customers’ age increases by one, for customers with the same skin color.
• Keeping customers’ age the same, the average number of quality flags that occurred during
a sleep session for customers with medium-dark skin, medium skin, medium-light skin and
light skin would be 39.36%, 70.24%, 80.07% and 90.83% less than the average number
of quality flags for a dark-skinned user, respectively. Thus, darker-skinned users have a
higher average number of quality flags. In other words, the darker skin color of customers
affects the performance of the sleep score function
